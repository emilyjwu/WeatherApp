<h1> Welcome! </h1>
This is a sample weather app I made for CS4261 (Mobile Apps & Services) at Georgia Tech. Through this application, you can create a new account and authenticate/store it using Firebase Auth. Once the account is created, you can sign in using the email/password. If the password is incorrect, an alert is displayed to the user. If the login is successful, the app flows to a screen showing the weather of the device's location!

In order to run this application, make sure XCode 15.0 is installed and clone the repo into your local directory.
